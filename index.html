    Covid & Health Insurance - A wake up call!
  </h1>
  <p class=" col-md-4 col-ms-12 col-xs-12 para">
    It was just a few months ago when insurance advisors had a herculean task to explain to their clients the importance of health insurance. First, people won’t understand why health insurance is important and if they got convinced they would debate that they are currently healthy and won’t require insurance for next few years or that their employer provides them with a group insurance. The excuses were many and only a handful of people ended up buying a private health cover for their families. In the last three months, we have seen a spurt and panic to get hold of an insurance policy and people are contacting their advisors desperately.  Many end up getting a policy successfully and many fail to get one due to pre- existing conditions clause.
  <br>
  <br>
    Covid has certainly left people thinking and health insurance is definitely on their priority list now. Insurance companies have earned goodwill by successfully settling Covid claims. The average claims range from anything between Rs.1.5 lakhs to 15 lakhs depending upon the severity of the case and hospital selected for treatment.
    <br>
    <br>
    In India the bottom of the pyramid is covered by the Ayushman Bharat Yojana and some government employees are covered by ECHS and other government schemes. That leaves a sizeable population without insurance cover. This is where private health companies come into play. 
    <br>
    <br>
  There are some big advantages of getting a health policy early on in India like It has a lifelong renewability clause which means an Insurance company will not deny you the right to renew your policy irrespective of the number of claims you may have taken. Unlike in developed countries, where the insurance company has a right to reject a policy on renewal depending upon your claim history or can subject you to advance medical tests and levy extra premium.
  <br>
  <br>
    Having a good health insurance cover should be on top of the list priority as we know one hospitalisation can erode your lifelong savings. It makes sense to have your own health plan even if you are covered by your company in a group plan. In a private health plan you are the owner of the health plan and can renew the policy for life whereas in a group plan you are just a member and do not decide on terms and conditions of the policy and you are covered till the time you are part of the group. Health insurance should not be seen as a cost, rather an investment which protects you financially in times of need. 
    <br>
    <br>
    The good news is that your existing health insurance policy covers covid and all new policies taken now will cover covid after 30 day waiting period clause. So if you have not planned a health insurance yet, do it now, and make sure that policy you take and the company you choose is for long term as you can renew your policy for life.
    <br>
    <br>
  Some do’s for buying a health policy for your family
  <br>
  <br>
    1. Always consult an advisor before buying a health policy. A cheaper product may not be the right product for you, maybe it's not giving you adequate cover that you are looking for.
    <br>
    <br>
  2. Buy a high sum Insured plan upward of 50 lakhs to 1 crore keeping in mind that getting a high sum insured plan is difficult to get as you grow old and also keep in mind medical inflation is in double digits.
  <br>
  <br>
 3. Buy a plan which offers a single deluxe room and no capping in ICU charges. If you are one of those who don't mind spending extra money you can opt for a suite room as well.
 <br>
 <br>
  4.  Take a health plan for your parents as there is no capping on entry age.
  <br>
  <br>
  5.  If you are a frequent traveller, opt for a plan with international benefits. You can get treated anywhere in the world for critical illnesses detected in India and also be covered for travel related medical emergencies.
